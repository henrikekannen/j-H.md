## Roles in Holacracy
---------------------
- In Holacracy the employees do not have "job descriptions" they are organized as **roles**
- When a new **role** is defined it is than assigned to a **member** of the organization to fill an **execute**
- One **member** can have **many different roles**
- Members **define** and **develop** these roles and can also decide which roles should be **abolished**

## New Meeting Format 
---------------------
### Governance Meetings
- Are held at least once a month 
- Governance meetings are not about operational issues its about defining, change or abolish roles and also to discuss internal issues

### Daily Stand up Meetings 
- Usually the beginning of a working day (5-10 minutes)
- Quick check-in about the task every circle member did the previous day and what are their plans for today

## New Meeting Format 
---------------------
### Tactical Meetings

- Focus on team's operational work 
- Discuss issues that came up lately and to solve problems
